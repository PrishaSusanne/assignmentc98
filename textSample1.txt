AFTER A MORNING OF STORM SPIRIT’S, goat men, and flying
boyfriends, Piper should’ve been losing her mind. Instead, all
she felt was dread.
It’s starting, she thought. Just like the dream said.
She stood in back of the chariot with Leo and Jason, while
the bald guy, Butch, handled the reins, and the blond girl,
Annabeth, adjusted a bronze navigation device. They rose
over the Grand Canyon and headed east, icy wind ripping
straight through Piper’s jacket. Behind them, more storm
clouds were gathering.
